Technical SEO & GEO for Developer Content
Make technical content discoverable by search engines and AI systems
Technical content only works if developers can find it through search engines or AI-assisted tools.
We help developer-focused teams improve the discoverability of technical content across traditional search (SEO) and AI-driven discovery (GEO) without compromising accuracy, depth, or developer trust.

Why discoverability breaks down for technical content
Developer content has unique challenges that traditional SEO approaches often miss.
Common problems we see:
SEO tactics that conflict with technical accuracy
Content written for keywords instead of developer intent
Documentation and blog content that search engines struggle to understand
High-quality content that performs poorly in AI-assisted discovery
No plan for keeping content discoverable as tools and models evolve
The result is content that may be technically strong but struggles to rank well.
Our approach to Technical SEO & GEO
We treat discoverability as a technical problem, not a checklist.
Our approach balances:
How developers search and evaluate tools
How search engines and AI systems interpret technical content
The need for clarity, structure, and context
The goal is to make content easier to discover without diluting its technical value.
Our Technical SEO & GEO process
1. Technical content audit
We review existing content to understand how it’s currently being interpreted.
This includes:
Content structure and hierarchy
Internal linking and contextual signals
Technical clarity and ambiguity
Opportunities to improve discoverability without rewriting from scratch
2. Intent and workflow alignment
We align content with real developer intent.
This includes:
Mapping queries to developer workflows and use cases
Identifying where content answers questions incompletely or unclearly
Clarifying terminology and assumptions for both humans and machines
This step ensures content reflects how developers actually think and search.
3. Structure and clarity improvements
We improve how content is structured and presented.
This may include:
Refining headings and section hierarchy
Improving summaries, introductions, and conclusions
Making workflows, tradeoffs, and decisions more explicit
Reducing ambiguity that confuses search engines or AI systems
4. GEO-focused optimization
We optimize content for AI-assisted discovery and retrieval.
This includes:
Making content easier for LLMs to parse and summarize
Clarifying relationships between concepts
Improving consistency across related content
Supporting accurate citation and reuse in AI-generated responses
5. Ongoing iteration and maintenance
Discoverability isn’t static.
We plan for:
Re-evaluating content as products and ecosystems change
Updating content to maintain visibility over time
Aligning SEO and GEO efforts with content refresh cycles
What we deliver
A Technical SEO & GEO engagement typically includes:
An audit of existing technical content
Clear recommendations for improving discoverability
Updated or optimized content structure
Guidance on intent alignment and terminology
A plan for maintaining visibility over time

How this fits with content strategy and production
Technical SEO & GEO works best when integrated with how content is planned and written.
We align optimization efforts with:
Content strategy and topic planning
Technical how-to guides and comparisons
Content refresh and maintenance plans
This ensures discoverability improvements compound rather than conflict with production.
